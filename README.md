# About the system

This test was performed with material-ui and flux react.
Since you did not need to do the back end, there is a file called data.json that simulates a json. I used the Flux architecture as if there was a service to be consumed.
The fecthUtils File is the only file that would have to be changed in order to consume a real service.

# Deploy

To deploy you just need to run npm start, and the web page will open. (localhost:300/).
